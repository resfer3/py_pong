# py_pong

- Done with pygame (first project with it)
- Computer play needs some work, right now it's like playing with a novice player
- TODO: Need to set rounds before game
- TODO: Better computer play

This was an interesting pursuit, this is my first barely playable game, and who knows
some other games may come in the future, and if they do, more complex, I hope.
